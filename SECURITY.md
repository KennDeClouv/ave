## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Ave CDN, we take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any issues you may find. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Privately disclose the vulnerability:** Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead, email us at [zuuliziluuz@gmail.com](mailto:zuuliziluuz@gmail.com) with details about the vulnerability.

2. **Include relevant information:** In your email, provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact it may have.

3. **Encryption:** If possible, encrypt your email using our PGP public key to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information. You can find our PGP public key [here](PUBLIC_KEY.asc).

4. **Response:** We will acknowledge receipt of your email within 24 hours and work with you to assess and address the reported vulnerability. We'll keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

## Bug Bounty Program

To incentivize and reward responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, Ave CDN operates a bug bounty program. If you discover a security vulnerability and comply with our responsible disclosure guidelines, you may be eligible for a monetary reward.

Please note that only vulnerabilities that meet our eligibility criteria will be considered for a bounty. Rewards will be determined based on the severity of the vulnerability and the quality of the report.

For more information about our bug bounty program, including eligibility criteria and reward amounts, please email us at [zuuliziluuz@gmail.com](mailto:zuuliziluuz@gmail.com).
